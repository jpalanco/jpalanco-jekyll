INTRO ACQUIRED

During 2014 I started working in Threat Intelligence, writing snort and yara rules, malware reversing reports, ... At the same time, I also found several open-source projects collecting and normalizing OSINT data like hashes, IP addresses, domains or URLs related to malicious activity. At that moment elasticsearch was emerging as database (before it was used as full-text search system) and it had sense to develop tools on top of ELK stack.

At that time I realized most of the OSINT data didn't have any context, so I thought it could be awesome to automate the process of threat intelligence creation using sandbox analysis.

During 2014 I created a PoC with [Guillermo Campillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillermo-campillo-perez-84ba9560/) and in 2015 I designed and developed Dinoflux with [Cristian Sandoval](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cenriquesz) who helped me in the past to develop [drainware](https://www.jpalanco.com/drainware/).
